What is a URL?
- Universal Resource Locators
- address for internet resource 

What is DNS?

What is a query string?
- The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
- GET: get data from the server
- POST: send data to the server

What is an HTTP request?
- Request from a client to a server, following HTTP Protocol 
- Ex: request for HTML from google.com

What is an HTTP response?
- Response from a server to a client, following HTTP Protocol 
- Ex: sends back website for google.com 

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
- Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
- Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
- Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control


What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
- turn "site.com" into IP Address XXX.XX.XX.XX using DNS 
- browser (client) sends HTTP request to server 
- server sends a response back to client 
- browser makes a DOM from HTML and finds any resources (CSS, JS, etc.)
- browser makes separate HTTP requests for resources and receives response from server
